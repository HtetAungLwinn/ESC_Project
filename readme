(FRONTEND and BACKEND features summary)


Sustainability:

Our application’s adaptive light and dark modes deliver tangible environmental benefits by reducing energy consumption on OLED and AMOLED devices, where darker pixels require less power. Automatic switching based on a user’s system preferences or local time of day minimizes glare and eye strain, which in turn lowers the rate of abandoned sessions and support requests. These efficiencies help us contribute to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 Affordable and Clean Energy through reduced power demand and to SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production by curbing digital waste and promoting more efficient use of device resources.

Inclusive and Diversity:

By collecting guests’ religious preferences at sign‑up, our platform equips hotel staff with the information they need to respectfully tailor each stay for the customer whether that means arranging appropriate meal options, preparing quiet prayer spaces, or offering relevant local guidance to ensure every visitor feels valued and understood.
